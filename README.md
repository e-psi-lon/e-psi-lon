## 👋 Hi everyone

Hey, I'm ***e_ψ_lon*** !
*Some sites don’t like ψ and underscores, so you’ll also see me as `e-psi-lon` or `e_psi_lon`.*

### 🧑‍💻 About me 

I'm an 18-year-old university student in second year of Computer Science. 
In high school I studied: 
- 🧮 Math
- 💻 NSI (*Numérique et Sciences Informatiques*)
- 🧪 Physics, and Chemistry (in Première)

### 🔧 What do I do 

- I started development with **Minecraft** datapacks and troll resources packs
- I now mostly code in **Kotlin**, **Python** and some **HTML**/**CSS**/**JavaScript**. I also know **C**, **PHP**
- Sometimes I have fun with *Brainfuck* and esolangs 
- I *want* to learn Java ☕... but I have something called ✨*la flemme*✨ (and I'll learn it this year anyway in class)

I use ~~Fedora~~ NixOS btw<br/>
Turns out epsilon means “very small” in math. Didn’t know that when I picked the name. Regret? Especially during math class — felt mentioned every time (but wasn’t). Too late? Absolutely.
