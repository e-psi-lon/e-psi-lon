## Hi everyone

Hey, I'm *e_ψ_lon* but some websites doesn't accept certain characters like ψ

### About me 

I'm an 18 years old university student who likes to code. I'm currently in first year in computer science. I used to study Math, Physics and Chemistry (only on my 2nd year of high school) and NSI (*Numérique et Sciences Informatiques* which means Digital and Computer Science) in high school and now.

### What do I do 

I make some **Minecraft** datapacks or resources pack and I use Python and Kotlin (and a little bit of JavaScript) but I also know C. I want to learn Java but I've something called ✨*la flemme*✨
